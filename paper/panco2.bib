CMB-S4 will dramatically advance cosmological studies by crossing critical thresholds in the search for the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves, in the determination of the number and masses of the neutrinos, in the search for evidence of new light relics, in constraining the nature of dark energy, and in testing general relativity on large scales.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}Millimetre-wave continuum astronomy is today an indispensable tool for both general astrophysics studies (e.g. star formation, nearby galaxies) and cosmology (e.g. cosmic microwave background and high-redshift galaxies). General purpose, large-field-of-view instruments are needed to map the sky at intermediate angular scales not accessible by the high-resolution interferometers (e.g. ALMA in Chile, NOEMA in the French Alps) and by the coarse angular resolution space-borne or ground-based surveys (e.g. \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}, ACT, SPT). These instruments have to be installed at the focal plane of the largest single-dish telescopes, which are placed at high altitude on selected dry observing sites. In this context, we have constructed and deployed a three-thousand-pixel dual-band (150 GHz and 260 GHz, respectively 2 mm and 1.15 mm wavelengths) camera to image an instantaneous circular field-of-view of 6.5 arcmin in diameter, and configurable to map the linear polarisation at 260 GHz.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}First, we are providing a detailed description of this instrument, named NIKA2 (New IRAM KID Arrays 2), in particular focussing on the cryogenics, optics, focal plane arrays based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors, and the readout electronics. The focal planes and part of the optics are cooled down to the nominal 150 mK operating temperature by means of an adhoc dilution refrigerator. Secondly, we are presenting the performance measured on the sky during the commissioning runs that took place between October 2015 and April 2017 at the 30-m IRAM telescope at Pico Veleta, near Granada (Spain).\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We have targeted a number of astronomical sources. Starting from beam-maps on primary and secondary calibrators we have then gone to extended sources and faint objects. Both internal (electronic) and on-the-sky calibrations are applied. The general methods are described in the present paper.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}NIKA2 has been successfully deployed and commissioned, performing in-line with expectations. In particular, NIKA2 exhibits full width at half maximum angular resolutions of around 11 and 17.5 arcsec at respectively 260 and 150 GHz. The noise equivalent flux densities are, at these two respective frequencies, 33{$\pm$}2 and 8{$\pm$}1 mJy s\textsuperscript{1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$}. A first successful science verification run was achieved in April 2017. The instrument is currently offered to the astronomy community and will remain available for at least the following ten years.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment being built on Cerro Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early 2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the experiment, motivate the design, and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands centered at: 27, 39, 93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes and one large-aperture 6-m telescope, with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers. Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization. The small aperture telescopes will target the largest angular scales observable from Chile, mapping {$\approx$} 10\% of the sky to a white noise level of 2 {$\mu$}K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, at a target level of {$\sigma$}(r)=0.003. The large aperture telescope will map {$\approx$} 40\% of the sky at arcminute angular resolution to an expected white noise level of 6 {$\mu$}K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, overlapping with the majority of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope sky region and partially with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. With up to an order of magnitude lower polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000 extragalactic sources.},

A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multicomponent, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multiwavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multiwavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators, and theorists.},

  abstract = {We investigate the regularity of cluster pressure profiles with REXCESS, a representative sample of 33 local (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 0.2) clusters drawn from the REFLEX catalogue and observed with \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$}. The sample spans a mass range of 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 10\textsuperscript{15{$<$}sup/{$>$} , where \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} is the mass corresponding to a density contrast of 500. We derive an average profile from observations scaled by mass and redshift according to the standard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean is remarkably low, at less than 30 per cent beyond 0.2 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, but increases towards the center. Deviations about the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state of the cluster. Morphologically disturbed systems have systematically shallower profiles while cooling core systems are more concentrated. The scaled profiles exhibit a residual mass dependence with a slope of \textasciitilde 0.12, consistent with that expected from the empirically-derived slope of the \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} \textendash{} \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation; however, the departure from standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero at \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. The scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling is smaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure is the quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics. Comparison with scaled data from several state of the art numerical simulations shows good agreement outside the core. Combining the observational data in the radial range [0.03\textendash 1] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} with simulation data in the radial range [1\textendash 4] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, we derive a robust measure of the universal pressure profile, that, in an analytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as a function of mass and redshift up to the cluster ``boundary''. Using this profile and direct spherical integration of the observed pressure profiles, we estimate the integrated Compton parameter \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$} and investigate its scaling with \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$}, the soft band X-ray luminosity. We consider both the spherically integrated quantity, \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{sph{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}), proportional to the gas thermal energy, and the cylindrically integrated quantity, \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{cyl{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$})=\emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{SZ{$<$}sub/{$>$} \emph{D{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{A{$<$}sub/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}, which is directly related to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal. From the low scatter of the observed \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{sph{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) \textendash{} \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation we show that variations in pressure profile shape do not introduce extra scatter into the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{sph{$<$}sub/{$>$}(\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) \textendash{} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation as compared to that from the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{X{$<$}sub/{$>$} \textendash{} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} relation.

This object exhibits a complex morphology with a clear bimodality observed in X-rays. However, it was detected and analysed in the Planck sample as a single, spherical cluster following a universal profile [1]. This model can lead to miscalculations of thermodynamical quantities, like the pressure profile. As future multiwavelength cluster experiments will detect more and more objects at higher redshifts (where we expect the fraction of merging objects to be higher), it is crucial to quantify this systematic effect. In this work, we use high-resolution observations of PSZ2 G091.83+26.11 by the NIKA2 camera to integrate the morphological characteristics of the cluster in our modelling. This is achieved by fitting a two-halo model to the SZ image and then by reconstruction of the resulting projected pressure profile. We then compare these results with the spherical assumption.},

  abstract = {Secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background are a treasure-trove of cosmological information. Interpreting current experiments probing them are limited by theoretical uncertainties rather than by measurement errors. Here we focus on the secondary anisotropies resulting from the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect; the amplitude of which depends critically on the average thermal pressure profile of galaxy groups and clusters. To this end, we use a suite of hydrodynamical TreePM-SPH simulations that include radiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei. We examine in detail how the pressure profile depends on cluster radius, mass, and redshift and provide an empirical fitting function. We employ three different approaches for calculating the tSZ power spectrum: an analytical approach that uses our pressure profile fit, a semianalytical method of pasting our pressure fit onto simulated clusters, and a direct numerical integration of our simulated volumes. We demonstrate that the detailed structure of the intracluster medium and cosmic web affect the tSZ power spectrum. In particular, the substructure and asphericity of clusters increase the tSZ power spectrum by 10\%-20\% at l \textasciitilde{} 2000-8000, with most of the additional power being contributed by substructures. The contributions to the power spectrum from radii larger than R 500 is \textasciitilde 20\% at l = 3000, thus clusters interiors (r {$<$} R 500) dominate the power spectrum amplitude at these angular scales.},

  abstract = {We describe the design of a new polarization sensitive receiver, spt-3g, for the 10-meter South Pole Telescope (spt). The spt-3g receiver will deliver a factor of \textasciitilde 20 improvement in mapping speed over the current receiver, spt-pol. The sensitivity of the spt-3g receiver will enable the advance from statistical detection of B-mode polarization anisotropy power to high signal-to-noise measurements of the individual modes, i.e., maps. This will lead to precise (\textasciitilde 0.06 eV) constraints on the sum of neutrino masses with the potential to directly address the neutrino mass hierarchy. It will allow a separation of the lensing and inflationary B-mode power spectra, improving constraints on the amplitude and shape of the primordial signal, either through spt-3g data alone or in combination with bicep2/keck, which is observing the same area of sky. The measurement of small-scale temperature anisotropy will provide new constraints on the epoch of reionization. Additional science from the spt-3g survey will be significantly enhanced by the synergy with the ongoing optical Dark Energy Survey (des), including: a 1\% constraint on the bias of optical tracers of large-scale structure, a measurement of the differential Doppler signal from pairs of galaxy clusters that will test General Relativity on \textasciitilde 200Mpc scales, and improved cosmological constraints from the abundance of clusters of galaxies},

These maps, which cover the \textasciitilde 2500 deg2 of the southern sky imaged by the SPT-SZ survey, represent a significant improvement over previous such products available in this region by virtue of their higher angular resolution ( \$1\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash,\textbackslash prime\}\textbackslash over\{.\} 25\$ for our highest-resolution Compton-y maps) and lower noise at small angular scales. In this work we detail the construction of these maps using linear combination techniques, including our method for limiting the correlation of our lowest-noise Compton-y map products with the cosmic infrared background. We perform a range of validation tests on these data products to test our sky modeling and combination algorithms, and we find good performance in all of these tests. Recognizing the potential utility of these data products for a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological analyses, including studies of the gas properties of galaxies, groups, and clusters, we make these products publicly available at http://pole.uchicago.edu/public/data/sptsz\_ymap and on the NASA/LAMBDA website.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature from 2500 deg2 of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. This work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at high significance in the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, which was completed in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of {$\xi$} = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76\%) of the {$\xi$} {$>$} 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95\%) of the {$\xi$} {$>$} 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z {$\sim$} 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c({$\rho$}crit) , the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z {$>$} 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters, the largest clearly defined objects in our Universe, are ideal laboratories to study in detail the cosmic evolution of the intergalactic intracluster medium (ICM) and the cluster galaxy population. For the ICM, which is heated to X-ray radiating temperatures, X-ray spectroscopy is the most important tool to obtain insight into the structure and astrophysics of galaxy clusters. The ICM is also the hottest plasma that can be well studied under thermal equilibrium conditions. In this review we recall the basic principles of the interpretation of X-ray spectra from a hot, tenuous plasma and we illustrate the wide range of scientific applications of X-ray spectroscopy. The determination of galaxy cluster masses, the most important prerequisite for using clusters in cosmological studies, rest crucially on a precise spectroscopic determination of the ICM temperature distribution. The study of the thermal structure of the ICM provides a very interesting fossil record of the energy release during galaxy formation and evolution, giving important constraints on galaxy formation models. The temperature and pressure distribution of the ICM gives us important insight into the process of galaxy cluster merging and the dissipation of the merger energy in form of turbulent motion. Cooling cores in the centers of about half of the cluster population are interesting laboratories to investigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation and energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy. The element abundances deduced from X-ray spectra of the ICM provide a cosmic history record of the contribution of different supernovae to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements and their spatial distribution partly reflects important transport processes in the ICM. Some discussion of plasma diagnostics for conditions out of thermal equilibrium and an outlook on the future prospects of X-ray spectroscopic cluster studies complete our review.},

X-ray observations of these largest clearly defined objects in our Universe have been by far the most fruitful approach that has provided us with rich astrophysical and cosmological insights. ESA's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra observatories have been the powerhorses of this research. In this article we therefore like to summarize the major advances made in the field of galaxy cluster research primarily by these two instruments. We will touch the progress in understanding the structure of galaxy clusters and its statistics, the AGN feedback processes in the center of clusters, cosmic evolution of clusters, cluster mass measurements, the thermodynamic structure of the intracluster medium and its chemistry, X-ray surveys of clusters, and the use of galaxy clusters for cosmological tests.},

  abstract = {The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) provides a unique way to map the large-scale structure of the universe as traced by massive clusters of galaxies. As a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, the SZE is insensitive to the redshift of the galaxy cluster, making it well-suited for studies of clusters at all redshifts, and especially at reasonably high redshifts (z {$>$} 1) where the abundance of clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology. Recent high signal-to-noise detections of the SZE have enabled interesting constraints on the Hubble constant and the matter density of the universe using small samples of galaxy clusters. Upcoming SZE surveys are expected to find hundreds to thousands of new galaxy clusters, with a mass selection function that is remarkably uniform with redshift. In this review we provide an overview of the SZE and its use for cosmological studies with emphasis on the cosmology that can, in principle, be extracted from SZE survey yields. We discuss the observational and theoretical challenges that must be met before precise cosmological constraints can be extracted from the survey yields.},

  abstract = {The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect and the X-ray emission offer separate and highly complementary probes of the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium. We present JoXSZ, the first publicly available code designed to jointly fit SZ and X-ray data coming from various instruments to derive the thermodynamic profiles of galaxy clusters. JoXSZ follows a fully Bayesian forward-modelling approach, accounts for the SZ calibration uncertainty, and for the X-ray background level systematic. It improves upon most current and not publicly available analyses because it adopts the correct Poisson-Gauss expression for the joint likelihood, makes full use of the information contained in the observations, even in the case of missing values within the datasets, has a more inclusive error budget, and adopts a consistent temperature in the various parts of the code, allowing for differences between X-ray and SZ gas-mass weighted temperatures when required by the user. JoXSZ accounts for beam smearing and data analysis transfer function, accounts for the temperature and metallicity dependencies of the SZ and X-ray conversion factors, adopts flexible parametrisation for the thermodynamic profiles, and on user request, allows either adopting or relaxing the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). When HE holds, JoXSZ uses a physical (positive) prior on the radial derivative of the enclosed mass and derives the mass profile and overdensity radii r\textsubscript{{$\Delta$}}. For these reasons, JoXSZ goes beyond simple SZ and electron density fits. We illustrate the use of JoXSZ by combining Chandra and NIKA data of the high-redshift cluster CL J1226.9+3332. The code is written in Python, it is fully documented, and the users are free to customise their analysis in accordance with their needs and requirements. JoXSZ is publicly available on GitHub.},

The fact that multiple cosmological probes (supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and CMB anisotropies), and other galaxy cluster analyses all favor significantly higher matter densities suggests the presence of systematic errors in the data or an incomplete modeling of the relevant physics. Cross checks with x-ray and microwave data, as well as independent constraints on the observable-mass relation from Sunyaev-Zeldovich selected clusters, suggest that the discrepancy resides in our modeling of the weak lensing signal rather than the cluster abundance. Repeating our analysis using a higher richness threshold ({$\lambda\geq$}30) significantly reduces the tension with other probes, and points to one or more richness-dependent effects not captured by our model.},

  abstract = {We report the joint analysis of single-dish and interferometric observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect from the galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145. We have developed a parametric fitting procedure that uses native imaging and visibility data, and tested it using the rich data sets from ALMA, Bolocam, and Planck available for this object. RX J1347.5-1145 is a very hot and luminous cluster showing signatures of a merger. Previous X-ray-motivated SZ studies have highlighted the presence of an excess SZ signal south-east of the X-ray peak, which was generally interpreted as a strong shock-induced pressure perturbation. Our model, when centred at the X-ray peak, confirms this. However, the presence of two almost equally bright giant elliptical galaxies separated by {$\sim$}100 kpc makes the choice of the cluster centre ambiguous, and allows for considerable freedom in modelling the structure of the galaxy cluster. For instance, we have shown that the SZ signal can be well described by a single smooth ellipsoidal generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile, where the best-fitting centroid is located between the two brightest cluster galaxies. This leads to a considerably weaker excess SZ signal from the south-eastern substructure. Further, the most prominent features seen in the X-ray can be explained as predominantly isobaric structures, alleviating the need for highly supersonic velocities, although overpressurized regions associated with the moving subhaloes are still present in our model.},

  abstract = {emcee is a Python library implementing a class of affine-invariant ensemble samplers for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This package has been widely applied to probabilistic modeling problems in astrophysics where it was originally published, with some applications in other fields. When it was first released in 2012, the interface implemented in emcee was fundamentally different from the MCMC libraries that were popular at the time, such as PyMC, because it was specifically designed to work with "black box" models instead of structured graphical models. This has been a popular interface for applications in astrophysics because it is often non-trivial to implement realistic physics within the modeling frameworks required by other libraries. Since emcee's release, other libraries have been developed with similar interfaces, such as dynesty (Speagle 2019). The version 3.0 release of emcee is the first major release of the library in about 6 years and it includes a full re-write of the computational backend, several commonly requested features, and a set of new "move" implementations.},

  abstract = {Les amas de galaxies repr\'esentent l'aboutissement du processus de formation des grandes structures, et forment les plus grands objets gravitationnellement li\'es de l'Univers. Leur abondance en masse et en redshift permet de tracer la distribution de mati\`ere et son \'evolution avec le temps, et constitue donc une sonde cosmologique. L'effet Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) permet de d\'etecter les amas de galaxies gr\^ace \`a leur empreinte sur le fond diffus cosmologique. Des catalogues d'amas ont pu \^etre dress\'es gr\^ace \`a l'observation de cet effet, notamment par le satellite Planck. Cependant, leur utilisation pour contraindre les param\`etres cosmologiques requiert la connaissance de la masse des amas, qui n'est pas une observable directe. Il est donc n\'ecessaire de s'appuyer sur des relations d'\'echelle liant les observables \`a la masse. Ces relations sont \'etalonn\'ees sur des \'echantillons d'amas dont les propri\'et\'es physiques sont caract\'eris\'ees avec un grand niveau de d\'etail, notamment gr\^ace \`a des observations \`a haute r\'esolution. Cette connaissance fine des propri\'et\'es des amas permet d'\'etudier les syst\'ematiques intervenant en cosmologie, comme l'impact de l'\'etat de relaxation des amas sur la relation d'\'echelle.Cette th\`ese s'inscrit dans le cadre du grand programme SZ de NIKA2, qui a pour but d'exploiter les observations \`a haute r\'esolution de l'effet SZ avec la cam\'era NIKA2 au t\'elescope de 30 m\`etres de l'IRAM pour \'etudier les propri\'et\'es d'un \'echantillon d'amas de galaxies distants. Le travail effectu\'e utilise des techniques statistiques avanc\'ees pour \'etudier les syst\'ematiques devant \^etre prise en compte en cosmologie avec des amas. Une partie de ce travail porte sur l'analyse des donn\'ees de NIKA2 afin de caract\'eriser les propri\'et\'es thermodynamiques des amas en tenant compte des syst\'ematiques associ\'ees aux observations SZ, aboutissant au d\'eveloppement d'un logiciel public permettant de contraindre les propri\'et\'es thermodynamiques des amas de galaxies \`a partir d'observations SZ. Les m\'ethodes d\'evelopp\'ees sont ensuite utilis\'ees pour caract\'eriser les propri\'et\'es de l'un des amas les plus complexes du programme, en exploitant notamment la synergie entre les observations NIKA2 et XMM-Newton de l'amas de r\'esolutions comparables. Par la suite, nous pr\'esentons une mod\'elisation statistique rigoureuse de la relation masse-observable dans le cas des observations SZ, en utilisant un mod\`ele bay\'esien hi\'erarchique permettant de tenir compte des syst\'ematiques affectant les mesures de masse et d'observable. Nous appliquons cette analyse sur des simulations r\'ealistes, permettant de mettre en \'evidence les biais et effets syst\'ematiques impliqu\'es dans cette analyse, et de pr\'edire les contraintes pouvant \^etre apport\'ees par les observations avec NIKA2 sur la relation masse-observable.},

We present a spatially resolved Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)/X-ray analysis of ACT-CL J0215.4+0030, a high-redshift (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.865) galaxy cluster of intermediate mass (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$\simeq$} 3.5 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{14{$<$}sup/{$>$} \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}) observed as part of the ongoing NIKA2 SZ large program, which is a follow-up of a representative sample of objects at 0.5 {$\leq$} \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\leq$} 0.9. In addition to the faintness and small angular size induced by its mass and redshift, the cluster is contaminated by point sources that significantly affect the SZ signal. This is therefore an interesting case study for the most challenging sources of the NIKA2 cluster sample. We present the NIKA2 observations of this cluster and the resulting data. We identified the point sources that affect the NIKA2 maps of the cluster as submillimeter galaxies with counterparts in catalogs of sources constructed by the SPIRE instrument on board the \emph{Herschel{$<$}i/{$>$} observatory. We reconstructed the ICM pressure profile by performing a joint analysis of the SZ signal and of the point-source component in the NIKA2 150 GHz map. This cluster is a very weak source that lies below the selection limit of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} catalog. Nonetheless, we obtained high-quality estimates of the ICM thermodynamical properties with NIKA2. We compared the pressure profile extracted from the NIKA2 map to the pressure profile obtained from X-ray data alone by deprojecting the public \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} observations of the cluster. We combined the NIKA2 pressure profile with the X-ray deprojected density to extract detailed information on the ICM. The radial distribution of its thermodynamic properties (the pressure, temperature and entropy) indicate that the cluster has a highly disturbed core. We also computed the hydrostatic mass of the cluster, which is compatible with estimations from SZ and X-ray scaling relations. We conclude that the NIKA2 SZ large program can deliver quality information on the thermodynamics of the ICM even for one of its faintest clusters after a careful treatment of the contamination by point sources.}}}}}}}}}}},

The code allows the user to take into account various features of millimeter observations, such as point spread function (PSF) convolution, pipeline filtering, correlated residual noise, and point source contamination, in a forward modeling approach. One of the key advantages of the code is the possibility to use binned, non-parametric pressure profiles, enabling the detection of pressure features better than smooth functions such as the traditionally used generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile. Another major upside is the performance of the software, enabling the extraction of the pressure profile and associated confidence intervals via MCMC sampling in times as short as a few minutes. We present the code and its validation on various realistic synthetic maps, of ideal spherical clusters, as well as of realistic, hydrodynamically simulated objects. We plan to publicly release the software in the coming months.},

  abstract = {Aims.               The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey has been carried out during the performance verification phase of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA telescope and was completed in November 2019. This survey is designed to provide the first eROSITA-selected sample of clusters and groups and to test the predictions for the all-sky survey in the context of cosmological studies with clusters of galaxies.                                         Methods.               In the area of \textasciitilde 140 square degrees covered by eFEDS, 542 candidate clusters and groups of galaxies were detected as extended X-ray sources with the               eSASS               source detection algorithm. We performed imaging and spectral analysis of the 542 cluster candidates with eROSITA X-ray data and studied the properties of the sample.                                         Results.               We provide the catalog of candidate galaxy clusters and groups detected by eROSITA in the eFEDS field down to a flux of \textasciitilde 10               \textendash 14               erg s               \textendash 1               cm               \textendash 2               in the soft band (0.5               \textendash{}               2 keV) within 1'. The clusters are distributed in the redshift range ɀ               =               [0.01, 1.3] with a median redshift ɀ               median               = 0.35. With eROSITA X-ray data, we measured the temperature of the intracluster medium within two radii, 300 kpc and 500 kpc, and constrained the temperature with {$>$}2               {$\sigma$}               confidence level for \textasciitilde 1/5 (102 out of 542) of the sample. The average temperature of these clusters is \textasciitilde 2 keV. Radial profiles of flux, luminosity, electron density, and gas mass were measured from the precise modeling of the imaging data. The selection function, the purity, and the completeness of the catalog are examined and discussed in detail. The contamination fraction is \textasciitilde 1/5 in this sample and is dominated by misidentified point sources. The X-ray luminosity function of the clusters agrees well with the results obtained from other recent X-ray surveys. We also find 19 supercluster candidates in this field, most of which are located at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.5, including one cluster at ɀ \textasciitilde{} 0.36 that was presented previously.                                         Conclusions.               The eFEDS cluster and group catalog at the final eRASS equatorial depth provides a benchmark proof of concept for the eROSITA All-Sky Survey extended source detection and characterization. We confirm the excellent performance of eROSITA for cluster science and expect no significant deviations from our pre-launch expectations for the final all-sky survey.},

  abstract = {The main limiting factor of cosmological analyses based on thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster statistics comes from the bias and systematic uncertainties that affect the estimates of the mass of galaxy clusters. High-angular resolution SZ observations at high redshift are needed to study a potential redshift or morphology dependence of both the mean pressure profile and of the mass-observable scaling relation used in SZ cosmological analyses. The NIKA2 camera is a new generation continuum instrument installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope. With a large field of view, a high angular resolution and a high-sensitivity, the NIKA2 camera has unique SZ mapping capabilities. In this paper, we present the NIKA2 SZ large program, aiming at observing a large sample of clusters at redshifts between 0.5 and 0.9, and the characterization of the first cluster oberved with NIKA2.},

  abstract = {We present the results of an X-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clusters selected in the 2500 deg2 South Pole Telescope survey and observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We divide the full sample into subsamples of \textasciitilde 20 clusters based on redshift and central density, performing a joint X-ray spectral fit to all clusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the temperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the temperature profile over 0 {$<$} r {$<$} 1.5R 500, which would be impossible on a per-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on average, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first constraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z = 0 to z = 1.2. We find that high-z (0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.2) clusters are slightly (\textasciitilde 30\%) cooler both in the inner (r {$<$} 0.1R 500) and outer (r {$>$} R 500) regions than their low-z (0.3 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with measured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average pressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Confirming earlier results from this data set, we find an absence of strong cool cores at high z, manifested in this analysis as a significantly lower observed pressure in the central 0.1R 500 of the high-z cool-core subset of clusters compared to the low-z cool-core subset. Overall, our observed pressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements, suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the core. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at r {$<\sptilde$} 0.7R 500\textemdash this may reflect a long-standing balance between cooling and feedback over long timescales and large physical scales. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r {$>\sptilde$} R 500 in our high-z subsample. This flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due to the enhanced (\textasciitilde 3\texttimes ) rate at which group-mass (\textasciitilde 2 keV) halos, which would go undetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z \textasciitilde{} 1. This work demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially resolved cluster properties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but the number of observed clusters is high.},

We show that the evolving ``cuspiness'' of clusters in the X-ray, reported by several previous studies, can be understood in the context of a cool core with fixed properties embedded in a self-similarly evolving cluster. We find no measurable evolution in the X-ray morphology of massive clusters, seemingly in tension with the rapidly rising (with redshift) rate of major mergers predicted by cosmological simulations.

Advances in SZ observations have largely been driven by developments in centimetre-, millimetre-, and submillimetre-wave instrumentation on ground-based facilities, with notable exceptions including results from the Planck satellite. Here we review the utility of the thermal, kinematic, relativistic, non-thermal, and polarised SZ effects for studies of galaxy clusters and other large scale structures, incorporating the many advances over the past two decades that have impacted SZ theory, simulations, and observations. We also discuss observational results, techniques, and challenges, and aim to give an overview and perspective on emerging opportunities, with the goal of highlighting some of the exciting new directions in this field.},

In addition, the CLASH dataset includes lensing convergence maps that can be converted into lensing estimates of the total mass of the cluster. One-dimensional mass profiles are used to derive integrated mass estimates accounting for systematic effects (data processing, modeling, etc.). Two-dimensional analysis of the maps can reveal substructures in the cluster and, therefore, inform us about the dynamical state of each system.

Open to the scientific community since October 2017, NIKA2 will provide key observations for the next decade to address a wide range of open questions in astrophysics and cosmology.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our aim is to present the calibration method and the performance assessment of NIKA2 after one year of observation.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We used a large data set acquired between January 2017 and February 2018 including observations of primary and secondary calibrators and faint sources that span the whole range of observing elevations and atmospheric conditions encountered by the IRAM 30-m telescope. This allowed us to test the stability of the performance parameters against time evolution and observing conditions. We describe a standard calibration method, referred to as the ``Baseline'' method, to translate raw data into flux density measurements. This includes the determination of the detector positions in the sky, the selection of the detectors, the measurement of the beam pattern, the estimation of the atmospheric opacity, the calibration of absolute flux density scale, the flat fielding, and the photometry. We assessed the robustness of the performance results using the Baseline method against systematic effects by comparing results using alternative methods.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We report an instantaneous field of view of 6.5{${'}$} in diameter, filled with an average fraction of 84\%, and 90\% of valid detectors at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively. The beam pattern is characterised by a FWHM of 17.6{${''}$} {$\pm$} 0.1{${''}$} and 11.1{${''}$} {$\pm$} 0.2{${''}$}, and a main-beam efficiency of 47\%{$\pm$}3\%, and 64\%{$\pm$}3\% at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively. The point-source rms calibration uncertainties are about 3\% at 150 GHz and 6\% at 260 GHz. This demonstrates the accuracy of the methods that we deployed to correct for atmospheric attenuation. The absolute calibration uncertainties are of 5\%, and the systematic calibration uncertainties evaluated at the IRAM 30-m reference Winter observing conditions are below 1\% in both channels. The noise equivalent flux density at 150 and 260 GHz are of 9 {$\pm$} 1 mJy s\textsuperscript{1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$} and 30 {$\pm$} 3 mJy s\textsuperscript{1/2{$<$}sup/{$>$}.

  abstract = {Taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broadfrequency range of the \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}satellite, we study the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and pressure profiles of 62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-month nominal survey. Careful reconstruction of the SZ signal indicates that most clusters are individually detected at least out to \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. By stacking the radial profiles, we have statistically detected the radial SZ signal out to 3 \texttimes{} \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}, i.e., at a density contrast of about 50\textendash 100, though the dispersion about the mean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range. Our measurement is fully consistent with previous \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}results on integrated SZ fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between SZ and X-ray measurements inside \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Correcting for the effects of the \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}beam, we have calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. This new constraint from SZ measurements is consistent with the X-ray constraints from \emph{XMM-Newton{$<$}i/{$>$} in the region in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1\textendash 1] \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}), and is in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. At larger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than most predictions from numerical simulations. Combining the SZ and X-ray observed profiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fit parameters [\emph{P{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$},\emph{c{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}\emph{,{$\gamma$},{$\alpha$},{$\beta<$}i/{$>$} ] = [6.41,1.81,0.31,1.33,4.13 ] . Using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirts we reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profile out to 3 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Within the temperature driven uncertainties, our \emph{Planck {$<$}i/{$>$}constraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gas fraction in halos.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Specific masks are defined to minimize foreground residuals and systematics. Using these masks, we compute the \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$}-map angular power spectrum and higher order statistics. From these we conclude that the \emph{y{$<$}i/{$>$}-map is dominated by tSZ signal in the multipole range, 20 {$<$}\emph{{$\mathscr{l}<$}i/{$><$} 600.

  abstract = {We present the all-sky \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources detected from the 29 month full-mission data. The catalogue (PSZ2) is the largest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest systematic all-sky surveyof galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which 1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data sets, and is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing {$>$}10\textsuperscript{3{$<$}sup/{$>$} confirmed clusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of 83\% on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the estimates of the SZ strength parameter \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{5\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}500{$<$}sub/{$>$}are robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate conversion to \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} requires the use of prior information on the cluster extent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical, and X-ray data sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart match. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a population of low-redshift X-ray under-luminous clusters revealed by SZ selection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent properties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected samples.}}}}}}}},

Our constraints on ensemble-average pressure profile parameters, in this study {$\gamma$}, C 500, and P 0, are consistent with those in previous studies, but for individual clusters we find discrepancies with the X-ray derived pressure profiles from the ACCEPT2 database. We investigate potential sources of these discrepancies, especially cluster geometry, electron temperature of the intracluster medium, and substructure. We find that the ensemble mean profile for all clusters in our sample is described by the parameters , cool core clusters are described by , and disturbed clusters are described by .

We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure profiles of the high redshift (\emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.89) galaxy cluster CLJ 1226.9+3332 as inferred from SZ data from the MUSTANG, NIKA, Bolocam, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} instruments, which all probe different angular scales.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. Our non-parametric algorithm makes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For MUSTANG, NIKA, and Bolocam we derive a non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good agreement among the instruments. In particular, we find that the non-parametric profiles are consistent with a fitted generalized Navaro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile. Given the ability of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} to constrain the total signal, we include a prior on the integrated Compton \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$} parameter as determined by \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$}.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. For a given instrument, constraints on the pressure profile diminish rapidly beyond the field of view. The overlap in spatial scales probed by these four datasets is therefore critical in checking for consistency between instruments. By using multiple instruments, our analysis of CLJ 1226.9+3332 covers a large radial range, from the central regions to the cluster outskirts: 0.05 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 1.1 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. This is a wider range of spatial scales than is typically recovered by SZ instruments. Similar analyses will be possible with the new generation of SZ instruments such as NIKA2 and MUSTANG2.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

La caract\'erisation des processus associ\'es \`a l'origine et \`a la croissance des grandes structures permet de contraindre des param\`etres cosmologiques via l'\'etude de la distribution des amas en fonction de leur masse et de leur redshift. Cependant, il existe un d\'esaccord statistiquement significatif observ\'e entre les contraintes cosmologiques \'etablies par l'\'etude des anisotropies primaires du fond diffus cosmologique et celles issues de l'analyse de la distribution des amas de galaxies. Cela pourrait signifier que le mod\`ele standard de la cosmologie est incomplet. L'une des m\'ethodes d'observation des amas de galaxie exploite l'effet Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) qui permet de contraindre la pression du gaz contenu dans ces derniers. Cette observable peut \^etre directement li\'ee \`a la masse des amas via une relation d'\'echelle et un profil de pression. Il est donc essentiel de caract\'eriser pr\'ecis\'ement ces derniers afin de limiter les potentiels biais et effets syst\'ematiques affectant les analyses cosmologiques. Cette th\`ese pr\'esente l'ensemble des travaux r\'ealis\'es dans cet objectif. Elle porte sur des th\'ematiques allant des observations SZ effectu\'ees avec la cam\'era NIKA2 install\'ee au t\'elescope de 30 m\`etres de l'IRAM jusqu'\`a l'estimation des param\`etres cosmologiques en passant par l'analyse des donn\'ees brutes de NIKA2 et des cartes SZ r\'ealis\'ees.Une part du travail de th\`ese pr\'esent\'e dans ce document est consacr\'ee \`a l'\'etude et l'am\'elioration des diff\'erentes \'etapes effectu\'ees, depuis les observations d'amas de galaxies au t\'elescope avec la cam\'era NIKA2 jusqu'\`a la production de cartes de l'effet SZ.

  abstract = {The complete characterization of the pressure profile of high-redshift galaxy clusters, from their core to their outskirts, is a major issue for the study of the formation of large-scale structures. It is essential to constrain a potential redshift evolution of both the slope and scatter of the mass-observable scaling relations used in cosmology studies based on cluster statistics. In this paper, we present the first thermal Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (tSZ) mapping of a cluster from the sample of the New IRAM Kids Arrays (NIKA2) SZ large program that aims at constraining the redshift evolution of cluster pressure profiles and the tSZ-mass scaling relation. We observed the galaxy cluster PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 at redshift \emph{z{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.58 with the NIKA2 camera, a dual-band (150 and 260 GHz) instrument operated at the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimtrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope. We identify a thermal pressure excess in the south-west region of PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 and a high-redshift sub-millimeter point source that affect the intracluster medium (ICM) morphology of the cluster. The NIKA2 data are used jointly with tSZ data acquired by the Multiplexed SQUID/TES Array at Ninety Gigahertz (MUSTANG), Bolocam, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} experiments in order to non-parametrically set the best constraints on the electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 0.02\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}) to its outskirts (\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 3\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}). We investigate the impact of the over-pressure region on the shape of the pressure profile and on the constraints on the integrated Compton parameter \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$}. A hydrostatic mass analysis is also performed by combining the tSZ-constrained pressure profile with the deprojected electronic density profile from \emph{XMM{$<$}i/{$>$}-\emph{Newton{$<$}i/{$>$}. This allows us to conclude that the estimates of \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} obtained from the analysis with and without masking the disturbed ICM region differ by 65\% and 79\%, respectively. This work highlights that NIKA2 will have a crucial impact on the characterization of the scatter of the \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>-$}\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{500{$<$}sub/{$>$} scaling relation due to its high potential to constrain the thermodynamic and morphological properties of the ICM when used in synergy with X-ray observations of similar angular resolution. This study also presents the typical products that will be delivered to the community for all clusters included in the NIKA2 tSZ Large Program.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Cosmological analyses based on surveys of galaxy clusters observed through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect strongly rely on the mean pressure profile of the cluster population. A tension is currently observed between the cosmological constraints obtained from the analyses of the CMB primary anisotropies and those from cluster abundance in SZ surveys. This discrepancy may be explained by a wrong estimate of the hydrostatic bias parameter that links the hydrostatic mass to the true mass of galaxy clusters. However, a variation of both the amplitude and the shape of the mean pressure profile could also explain part of this tension. We analyse the effects of a modification of this profile on the constraints of the {$\sigma$}8 and {$\Omega$}m parameters through the analysis of the SZ power spectrum measured by the Planck collaboration. We choose two mean pressure profiles that are respectively lower and higher than the one obtained from the observation of nearby clusters by Planck. The selection of the parameters of these two profiles is based on the current estimates of the pressure and gas mass fraction profile distributions at low redshift. The cosmological parameters found for these two profiles are significantly different from the ones obtained with the Planck pressure profile. We conclude that an {$\sim$} 15 per cent decrease of the amplitude of the mean normalized pressure profile would alleviate the tension observed between the constraints of {$\sigma$}8 and {$\Omega$}m from the CMB and cluster analyses without requiring extreme values of the mass bias parameter.},

We present the results of a multiwavelength analysis of the very massive cluster MOO J1142+1527 at a redshift z = 1.2 discovered as part of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. This analysis is based on high angular resolution Chandra X-ray and NIKA2 Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (SZ) data. The cluster thermodynamic radial profiles have been obtained with unprecedented precision at this redshift and up to 0.7R 500, thanks to the combination of high-resolution X-ray and SZ data. The comparison between the galaxy distribution mapped in infrared by Spitzer and the morphological properties of the ICM derived from the combined analysis of the Chandra and NIKA2 data leads us to the conclusion that the cluster is an ongoing merger. We have estimated a systematic uncertainty on the cluster total mass that characterizes both the impact of the observed deviations from spherical symmetry and of the core dynamics on the mass profile. We further combine the X-ray and SZ data at the pixel level to obtain maps of the temperature and entropy distributions. We find a relatively low-entropy core at the position of the X-ray peak and high-temperature regions located on its south and west sides. This work demonstrates that the addition of spatially resolved SZ observations to low signal-to-noise X-ray data brings a high information gain on the characterization of the evolution of ICM thermodynamic properties at z {$>$} 1.},

The mean scaled pressure in the low-\$z\$ sample is lower at small radii and higher at large radii, a trend that is accurately reproduced in similarly selected samples from The300 simulations. This difference appears to be primarily due to dynamical state at small radii, evolution at intermediate radii, and a combination of evolution and mass dependence at large radii. Furthermore, the overall flattening of the mean scaled pressure profile in the low-\$z\$ sample compared to the mid-\$z\$ sample is consistent with expectations due to differences in mass accretion rate and the fractional impact of feedback mechanisms. In agreement with previous studies, the fractional scatter about the mean scaled pressure profile reaches a minimum of \$\textbackslash simeq 20\$ per cent near 0.5R\$\_\{500\}\$. This scatter is consistent between the low-\$z\$ and mid-\$z\$ samples at all radii, suggesting it is not strongly impacted by sample selection, and this general behavior is reproduced in The300 simulations. Finally, analytic functions that approximately describe the mass and redshift trends in mean pressure profile shape are provided.},

  abstract = {I present a general family of dynamical models with simple analytical potential-density pairs suited to modelling galactic bulges and nuclei with double power-law radial density profiles and an optional central black hole. Analytical expressions for the potential and velocity dispersion of these models are given for the spherical case. Many previously known analytical spherical models, including the recent gamma/eta-models by Dehnen and Tremaine et al., are special cases of this family. The family also forms a complete set for constructing general galaxy models or solving Poisson's equation in the non-spherical case. In particular, a generalized Clutton-Brock and Hernquist-Ostriker orthogonal basis set is given.},
